UserAdmin is a MediaWiki extension which allows administrators to add users, 
permanently remove spam or unused accounts, change user passwords, edit user 
details, send reset password or welcome emails and list users with pagination 
and filter controls. This extension is primarily for administrators of 
private wikis that require tighter control of user accounts.

Usage:
	require_once("$IP/extensions/UserAdmin/UserAdmin.php"); in LocalSettings.php

If $wgUserAdminExternalAuth is true, then password options are not used. It is
assumed that users are authenticated against an external authority such as LDAP.
